# PLORT

Another primitive testbed for a game concept, this time with intent to make three interfaces to the "gameplay":

  1. Text adventure
  2. Roguelike
  3. Realtime physics sim

-------

To run the specs, you may need to install telescope via luarocks to get the dependencies, even though a copy is included here.

Then, `make test` should do it -- using different launchers for different platforms
